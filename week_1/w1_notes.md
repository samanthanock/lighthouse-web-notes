—— Incremental Programming —— Khuram

- Error driven development, learning from errors/ causing errors purposefully.

#Solving the Problem:

- Breaking the problem down, pseudo coding/ what’s the logic? Counter to working incrementally.
- Defining the problem as well as possible.
- What are the parameters/inputs of the program?
- What is the output at the end?
- Write code that will test the behaviour.
- Refactor the code that you wrote earlier// clean-up as you go.
- Thinking about and writing a plan for handling ‘edge cases’ (vs just following the ‘happy path’).

##Incremental Approach:

- Create an error // guess the error
- Hypothesis of solution
- Solve that error (and just that error)
- Test, confirm/deny solution
- Is there a better solution?
- Repeat

###Take-Aways:

- Working incrementally is key, even when using pseudocode
- Start with small working programs, and then add features
- Cause errors and work from the error
- Refactor as you go, incrementally writing code helps w/ this
